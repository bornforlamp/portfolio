_Dear Scott,_

_Thanks for contacting Vercel Support! I’m Harshad and I’d be happy to help with your inquiry._

_To redirect any url on your project to another site, you can use [In-Application redirect](https://vercel.com/support/articles/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects?query=redire#in-application-redirects) method, you’ll have to deploy next.config.js which should contain following code:_

```
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/about',
        destination: '/',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```
_Push the file to your GitHub repository and then click the redeployment button in Vercel dashboard if you want to manually redeploy your changes, else Vercel will
automatically redeploy the changes made to your project from your GitHub repository._

_Hope this helps!_

_If you have any more questions, please feel free to write back to us. Have a nice day!

_Best regards,_
_Harshad Mane_
